This project is an additional application for a voltage stabilizer that allows for extended parameter monitoring, sending data via MQTT,
remotely receiving settings from a client application, and receiving data on it. 
The application enables user registration and the management of multiple devices of different types (stabilizers, phase multimeters, etc.). 
An ESP32-based board is used as the controller.
